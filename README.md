Biological Sequence Classification using Deep Learning Architectures. Proceedings of ICICC 2022

Finding similar biological sequences to categorize into respective families is an important task. 
The present works attempt to use machine learning based approaches to find the family of a given sequence. 
The first task in this direction is to convert the sequences to vector representations and then train a model using a suitable machine learning architecture. 
The second task is to find which family the sequence belongs to. In this work, deep learning-based architectures are proposed to do the task. 
A comparative study on how effective various deep learning architectures for this problem is also discussed in this work.
